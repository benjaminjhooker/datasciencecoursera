## Machine Learning Project
The code is rather straight forward in an attempt to use the `caret` package material from the class.

## Processing times
I should have added some sort of benchmarking to measure the time it took to run the ML portions, suffice it to say,
that as I write this, the code has run for well over 39 minutes.  Furthermore, my HTML file, the one posted on this site
seems to not want to display outputs.  I am attempting to run it as a github document, but I don't know if that will fix
the issue.

## Random Forests
I did attempt a random forest algorithm, but it was running over hours of processing time.  My mac only has 8GB of RAM, so 
I konw this is, in part, a limitation on my computer.  I learned earlier today of another package that might help in processing
speeds `partykit`, but I have yet to employ it.

## Accuracy
My predictions on the quiz were 100% using the `gbm` model, so I decided that was the best course for me.  This is also noted in 
the markdown file (which doesn't have the outputs).
